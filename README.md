# Incident & SLA Performance Analytics

## Project Overview
This project analyzes incident and SLA performance data from a simulated production support environment. The goal is to identify SLA breaches, recurring failure patterns, and high-impact services requiring engineering focus.

## Tools Used
- SQL (SQLite / PostgreSQL)
- Python (pandas, matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Questions
- What percentage of incidents breach SLA?
- Which priorities and services drive SLA failures?
- What root causes contribute most to repeat incidents?

## Dataset
Synthetic but realistic incident data modeled on real-world TAC and production support workflows.

## Outcomes
- Identified services and root causes responsible for most SLA breaches
- Recommended remediation focus areas to improve system reliability
